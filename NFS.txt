THEORY OF NFS
NFS (Network File System) is basically developed for sharing of files and folders between Linux/Unix systems.
It allows you to mount your local file systems over a network and remote hosts to interact with them as they are mounted locally on the same system. 
With the help of NFS, we can set up file sharing between Unix to Linux system and Linux to Unix system.
1)NFS is a network that was introduced by Sun Microsystems and is used by Unix or Linux based operating systems and stands for Network File System
2)This is a network that is used for giving the remote access capabilities to the applications
3) Remote access enables the user to edit or even take a closer look at his computer by using another computer.
4) Old files can be repaired even when the user is at a distance from his computer. 
5)This protocol gives devices the functionality to modify the data over a network.
6)NFS does not provide sessions
7)It uses 111 port for both TCP and UDP
8)It is simple to implement and executing query is fast
9)It is not reliable and there is no special security
10)It is better than CIFS
There are 4 versions of nfs - nfsv2, nfsv3, nfsv4
NFSv2
Request are host based and not user based
TCP or UDP
supports 2GB file size on clients
NFSv3
fixes bugs of v2
TCP or UDP
Request host based not user based
support is based on server file limit
NFSv4
Stateful protocol TCP or SCTCP
Security features, kerberos
Client authentication per user basis
RPC (Remote Procedural Call)
Listens on port 2049

Commands:-

$sudo apt-get -y install nfs-kernel-server

$sudo systemctl enable nfs-kernel-server

[Create a directory to show the function of nfs i.e(mounting)]

$mkdir demo_dir
$touch a.txt

$cat /etc/exports

[configure your exports file by adding /directory_path/ ipaddr (permissions)]

$sudo exportfs -ra

$sudo apt-get -y install nfs-common

$sudo mount -t nfs /directorytoexport client_ip_ntwrk (permissions) 

[then check for your mounted file in the directory you made]
